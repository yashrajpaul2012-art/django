The Taj Mahal is perhaps the most recognized symbol of India. It is located in Agra, on the banks of the Yamuna River, in the state of Uttar Pradesh. Built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his beloved wife Mumtaz Mahal, it is a symbol of eternal love and devotion. Construction of the Taj Mahal began in 1632 and took about 22 years to complete, involving thousands of artisans and craftsmen from across the empire.

The Taj Mahal is made of white marble, brought in from Makrana in Rajasthan. Its architecture blends elements from Persian, Islamic, and Indian styles. The central dome rises to a height of about 73 meters, surrounded by four slender minarets. The entire structure is set within a vast complex that includes gardens, fountains, a mosque, and a guesthouse.

The walls of the Taj Mahal are decorated with precious stones, calligraphy from the Quran, and delicate floral carvings. The monument is especially breathtaking during sunrise and sunset when the marble reflects different shades of light. In 1983, it was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and in 2007, it was included among the New Seven Wonders of the World.

Millions of visitors from around the world come to Agra each year to witness the magnificence of the Taj Mahal. Despite its age, the monument continues to inspire poets, artists, and travelers with its timeless beauty
